Description: zeromq-based Oxen message passing library (headers)
 This C++17 library contains an abstraction layer around ZeroMQ to support
 integration with Oxen authentication, RPC, and message passing.  It is
 designed to be usable as the underlying communication mechanism of SN-to-SN
 communication ("quorumnet"), the RPC interface used by wallets and local
 daemon commands, communication channels between oxend and auxiliary services
 (storage server, lokinet), and also provides a local multithreaded job
 scheduling within a process.
 .
 This package contains the library headers and other development files needed
 to build software using oxenmq.
